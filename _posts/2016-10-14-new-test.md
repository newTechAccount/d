* This is the first line. Since the first non-space characters appears in
  column 3, all other indented lines have to be indented 2 spaces.
However, one could be lazy and not indent a line but this is not
recommended.
*       This is the another item of the list. It uses a different number
   of spaces for indentation which is okay but should generally be avoided.
   * The list item marker is indented 3 spaces which is allowed but should
     also be avoided and starts the third list item. Note that the lazy
     line in the second list item may make you believe that this is a
     sub-list which it isn't! So avoid being lazy!
